## 🧩 What Is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct place in the already sorted part—like sorting playing cards in your hand.

## 🐌 Brute Force Insertion Sort

### 🔍 Description
- Starts from index 1 and compares each element backward with its left neighbors.
- Shifts elements as needed and inserts at the correct spot.
- Best for small or nearly sorted arrays.

### ✅ Code
```python
def insertion_sort_brute(arr, n):
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            if arr[j] < arr[j - 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j - 1] = arr[j - 1], arr[j]
            else:
                break
    return arr

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input("Enter the number of elements: "))
    arr = list(map(int, input("Enter elements: ").strip().split()))[:n]
    print("Brute Force Insertion Sort:", insertion_sort_brute(arr, n))
```

## ⚡ Optimized Insight: Reduce Comparisons with Early Break

Insertion Sort already breaks early when the current element is correctly placed, so it's inherently adaptive. However, a slight tweak is to store the value instead of repeated swaps—which can reduce writes.

### ✨ Smarter Version (Less Swapping)
```python
def insertion_sort_optimized(arr, n):
    for i in range(1, n):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]  # Shift right
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key  # Place key at correct spot
    return arr

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input("Enter the number of elements: "))
    arr = list(map(int, input("Enter elements: ").strip().split()))[:n]
    print("Optimized Insertion Sort:", insertion_sort_optimized(arr, n))
```

## 📊 Time & Space Complexity

| Case      | Time Complexity | Notes                          |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Best      | O(n)             | Already sorted array           |
| Average   | O(n²)            | Moderate disorder              |
| Worst     | O(n²)            | Reversed order                 |
| Space     | O(1)             | In-place, no extra array       |
| Stability | ✅ Yes           | Preserves order of duplicates  |

## 🧠 Real-World Use

| Situation                        | Use Insertion Sort? | Why                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Nearly sorted data               | ✅ Yes               | Adaptive and efficient               |
| Small datasets                   | ✅ Yes               | Simple and low overhead              |
| Teaching core concepts           | ✅ Yes               | Shows shifting vs swapping clearly   |
| Large datasets                   | ❌ No                | Too slow for scale; use Merge/Quick  |
